            <p>In 1959 in a hilly alcove known as Chavez Ravine, the construction of today’s Los Angeles landmark, Dodger Stadium, began.

Instead of focusing on Main Street as a money-earner, Disney concentrated on developing sensory experiences. Main Street served “as the gateway to Disneyland’s virtual reality” as guests would “walk through a tunnel and emerge in another world (Dehrer 38-9).</p>
